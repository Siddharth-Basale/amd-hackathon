### Part D

Are there any benefits payable on Surrender of Your policy? Let's take a look.

#### 1. Benefits payable on Surrender

&lt;&lt; Since you have chosen the Return of Premium option: &gt;&gt;

Your Guaranteed Surrender Value (GSV) gets acquired immediately upon payment of Premium in case of SP and upon payment of Premiums for at least 2 years in case of LP/RP.

The Company may pay a surrender value higher than the GSV in the form of a Special Surrender Value (SSV). SSV shall become payable after completion of first policy year provided one full year premium has been received for Limited/Regular Pay and immediately on the receipt of single premium for Single Pay

Your Surrender Value will be the higher of Guaranteed Surrender Value (GSV) and Special Surrender Value (SSV) Where,

GSV = GSV Factor% × Total Premiums Paid

For GSV Factors refer to Appendix 1.

SSV shall be calculated as the expected present value of:

- i) Paid-up guaranteed future benefits on death, survival/maturity and
2. ii) accrued / vested benefits, duly allowing for survival benefits already paid, if any

The discount rate used to calculate the expected present value shall be equal to the yield on 10 Year G-Sec plus 50 basis points.

Currently, the interest rate used for calculating the expected present value is 7.75% p.a.

The discount rates shall be reviewed at least once annually and in case of any significant movement in the yields. The revised discount rates shall apply to all policies including the policies already sold.
