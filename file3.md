### Part D

Are there any benefits payable on Surrender of your policy? Let's take a look.

#### 1. Benefits payable on Surrender

Your Surrender value gets acquired immediately upon payment of Premium in case of Single Pay and upon completion of first policy year 2 years in case of Limited Pay, provided one full year premium has been received. The surrender benefits are payable immediately on surrender. Surrender Value will be calculated as follows:

##### a. Life Option

Surrender Value shall become payable after completion of first policy year provided at least one full year premium has been received for Limited Pay and immediately on the receipt of single premium for Single Pay

Surrender Value = 75% × Accumulated Premium Value^ ÷ (100 - Age at Entry) × Max (100 - Age at Surrender, 0)

^Accumulated till date of surrender

##### b. Return of Premium (RoP) Option

Your Surrender Value will be the higher of Guaranteed Surrender Value (GSV) and Special Surrender Value (SSV),

Guaranteed Surrender Value gets acquired immediately upon payment of premium in case of SP and upon  payment  of  premiums  for  at  least  2  years  in  case  of  LP.  SSV  shall  become  payable  after completion of first policy year provided at least one full year premium has been received for Limited Pay and immediately on the receipt of single premium for Single Pay. GSV = Max(GSV Factor × Total Premiums Paid - any survival benefits applicable till date, 0)

SSV = SSV Factor% ×Total Premiums Paid

Where GSV factors are:

| Policy Year | GSV Factor |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Single Pay | Limited Pay |
| 1 | 75% | 0% |
| 2 | 75% | 30% |
| 3 | 75% | 35% |
| 4 to 7 | 90% | 50% |
| 8 to (97 less Age at Entry) | 90% | 50% + 40% × (Policy Year - 7) ÷ (91 - Age at Entry) |
| (98 less Age at Entry) onwards | 90% | 90% |

SSV shall  be calculated as  the  discounted  value  of  all  outstanding  survival  benefits,  calculated  using prevailing Discounting Rate.

F&amp;U dated: September2024

<!-- image -->

<!-- page break -->

<!-- image -->

Where, Discounting Rate shall be based on prevailing interest rates, derived from yields of the 30 years GSec security. Any change in the interest rate used will be in accordance with the formula below:

Annualized Yield on reference government bond + k, rounded up to the nearest 25 basis points.

## Where k = 150 basis points

The Discounting Rate will be reviewed semi-annually and shall be revised using the  above  mentioned formula and the any change shall be effective from 25th February and 25th August each year.

SSV shall be calculated as the expected present value of:

- i) Paid-up guaranteed future benefits on death, survival/maturity and
2. ii) accrued / vested benefits, duly allowing for survival benefits already paid, if any

The discount rate used to calculate the expected present value shall be equal to the yield on 10 Year G-Sec plus 50 basis points.

Currently, the interest rate used for calculating the expected present value is 7.75% p.a.

The discount rates shall be reviewed at least once annually and in case of any significant movement in the yields. The revised discount rates shall apply to all policies including the policies already sold.

The  calculation  of  SSV  in  the  product  is  in  compliance  with  Clause  4(5)  of  Schedule  I  of  IRDAI (Insurance  Products)  Regulations,  2024  and  clause  26.4  of  Master  circular  on  Life  Insurance  Products dated 12 th June, 2024

GSV expressed as a % of Total Premiums Paid for sample model points is provided in the Appendix 2(a).

Surrender Value progression as a % of Total Premiums Paid for sample cases is provided in Appendix 2(b).

Comparison of SSV and Notional Asset Share for sample model points has been provided in Appendix 2(c)

### 2. Lapse &amp; Paid-up

### When will your policy acquire a paid-up value?

A policy can acquire paid-up value only when premiums for at least 1 full year are paid Such a policy shall not lapse by the reason of non-payment of further premium but shall be kept in-force to the extent of the Reduced Paid-up Benefit. In all other cases, the policy lapses on premium discontinuance without any paidup value.

Sum Assured on Death and Survival Benefit for a paid-up policy shall be calculated as follows:

Paid-up value = In-force value × Number of premiums paid ÷ Total Number of premiums payable

The minimum death benefit for a reduced paid-up policy shall be at least 105% of total premiums paid till the date of death.

#### 3. Loans

### Can you avail a loan under this Policy?
